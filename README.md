# Splunk Log Investigation Lab

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project involved using **Splunk Cloud** to simulate a real-world log analysis scenario. I worked with indexed data to investigate events and identify failed login attempts and key data patterns.

## 📄 What I Did

- Uploaded sample log files to Splunk Cloud.
- Performed keyword and field-based searches across large datasets.
- Identified different data sources and extracted key metadata.
- Investigated failed SSH login attempts for the root account.
- Practiced filtering and narrowing down results through search queries.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Splunk Cloud**: Log management and search platform.
- **Sample Logs**: Structured machine data for practice.
- **Query Language (SPL)**: For constructing and refining searches.
